=== Unit testing ===
* Exceptional errors in test cases now do not surpass previous success or error messages in the same test run.
* Bugfix: Successful assertion results of AssertFalse() in testcases are now reported correctly.    

=== Active record ===
* Optimization: Satori doesn't rebuild relations when an object is made persistent unless they have been used previously.
* Optimization: Satori doesn't lookup target objects in relations whose primary key values in autoincrement columns are zero.
* Introduced the new "locale" setting.
* Added Satori events OnBeforeUpdate, OnBeforeCreate, OnBeforeDelete, and OnDelete.
* Satori Delete function is no longer overridable -- use the relevant events for handling deletions.
* Satori "Relations" are redefined when an object is made persistent to allow for manual morphing.

=== Water ===
* Undefined variables now throw exceptions.
* Added water setting 'jsonstartdepth' to allow for limiting the depth of error reporting.
