Rabbit is a rapid application development framework in PHP for PHP.

We used Rabbit with my team, Kamibu, to develop
[Zino Phoenix](https://github.com/dionyziz/zino/tree/master/phoenix), the previous version
of Zino, a greek social network.

Rabbit is very OOP and supports many popular patterns often seen in modern frameworks such
as active record. It contains many interesting ideas such as a deviation from MVC and into
a frontend/backend-only structure separation, Coala (a good AJAX framework), a great way of
introducing type and user input validation in PHP, and a powerful debugging system.

It is also slow and in many ways unoptimized and "too much object oriented" where
unnecessary. This repository exists here for historical purposes, because it is part of 
the software architecture learning path I took. You are welcome to use this framework,
although I do not recommend it. You are more welcome to take ideas from it and use them
in your own projects, including code.
